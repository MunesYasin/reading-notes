# Expressions and Operators
`JavaScript` has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Arithmetic operators
* Bitwise operators
* Logical operators
* String operators
* Conditional (ternary) operator
* Comma operator
* Unary operators
* Relational operators


Name | Shorthand operator |Meaning 
 ------------ | -------------
 Assignment |	x = y |	x = y
Addition assignment|	x += y|	x = x + y
Subtraction assignment|	x -= y|	x = x - y
Multiplication assignment|	x *= y|	x = x * y
Division assignment|	x /= y|	x = x / y
Remainder assignment|	x %= y|	x = x % y
Exponentiation assignment|	x **= y	|x = x ** y
Left shift assignment|	x <<= y|	x = x << y
Right shift assignment|	x >>= y|	x = x >> y
Unsigned right shift assignment|	x >>>= y|	x = x >>> y

## Loops and iteration
There are  statements for loops provided in JavaScript are :

* for statement
* do...while statement
* while statement
* labeled statement
* break statement
* continue statement
* for...in statement
* for...of statement

## A `for` statement looks as follows:
for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  {statement}

  ## A `while` statement looks as follows:
  while (condition)
  {statement} 


## The main difference between for loop and while loop



  The difference between `for` loop and `while` loop is that in for loop the number of iterations to be done is already known and is used to obtain a certain result whereas in while loop the command runs until a certain condition is reached and the statement is proved to be false.
