**For long tables you can split the table into a , , and .**
**Functions, Methods, and Objects**
Creating an object: constructor notation var hotal = new oBJECT (); hotal.property = "anything"; hotal.checkAvalability = function(){ return ,,,,, ; }; ```

Update an object `name.property = value ;`
# CREATING OBJECTS USING
CONSTRUCTOR SYNTAX: Name.PropertyName()

# CREATE & ACCESS OBJECTS
CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION : we create one and make a new one by change his properties. we can delete propertyby :

`delete ObjectName.Property`

# OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION
The function can be used to create multiple objects.

`note: this commonly objects and functions`
# A METHOD OF AN OBJECT ; function inside object
## Storing data :
in arrays and objects the name calls key

note ; If the order of the items is important, use an array.

WHAT ARE BUILT-IN OBJECTS? it is like browser window ; Browsers come with a set of built-in objects
