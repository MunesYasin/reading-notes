# HTML 



The *HTML* is a markup language that is used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content to display it in the required format.
Tags in HTML: Tags are one of the most important part in an HTML Document. HTML uses some predefined tags which tells the browser about content display property, that is how to display a particular given content.

**For Example**, to create a paragraph, one must use the paragraph tags **(p /p)** and to insert an image one must use the img tags **(img /)**. 
There are generally two types of tags in HTML: 
 

**Paired Tags**: These tags come in pairs. That is they have both opening **(< >)** and closing **(</ >)** tags.

**Empty Tags**: These tags do not require to be closed.

## HTML STRUCTURE 

An HTML Document is mainly divided into two parts: 
 

**HEAD**: This contains the information about the HTML document. *For Example*, Title of the page, version of HTML, Meta Data etc.

**BODY**: This contains everything you want to display on the Web Page.

Every Webpage must contain this code. Below is the complete explanation of each of the tag used in the above piece of HTML code:

**!DOCTYPE html**: This tag is used to tells the HTML version. This currently tells that the version is HTML 5.

**html**: This is called HTML root element and used to wrap all the code.
  
**head**: Head tag contains metadata, title, page CSS etc. All the HTML elements that can be used inside the <head> element are: 
 
  
  
  
  
  <ul>
  <li>style</li>
  <li>title</li>
  <li>base</li>
    <li>noscript</li>
    <li>script</li>
    <li>meta</li>
    
</ul>

  
**body**: Body tag is used to enclose all the data which a web page has from texts to links. All the content that you see rendered in the browser is contained within this element. 

  ## EXTRA MARKUP 
  Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML.

Each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added and older code removed).

There have also been several versions of each browser used to view web pages, each of which implements new code. Not all web users, however, have the latest browsers installed on their computers, which means that not everyone will be able to view all of the latest features and markup.

  ## HTML Layout Elements 
  
  **HTML** has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:
  
  <ul>
    <li>header - Defines a header for a document or a section</li>
      <li>nav - Defines a set of navigation links</li>
        <li>section - Defines a section in a document</li>
          <li>article - Defines an independent, self-contained content</li>
            <li>aside - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)</li>
              <li>footer - Defines a footer for a document or a section</li>
                <li>details - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand</li>
                  <li>summary - Defines a heading for the details element</li>
  </ul>
 
    
 ## HTML Layout Techniques

There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:
<ul>
   <li>CSS framework</li>
      <li>CSS float property</li>
         <li>CSS flexbox</li>
  <li>CSS grid</li>
    </ul>
  
  ## The ABC of Programming

A script is a series of instructions To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task java script runs where it is found in the html. 
  
  If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
