# Layout
## CSS treats each element in htlm as block

1. Block-level elements h1,h2 ... h6 p ,ul , li
2. Inline elements img , b , i
## Controlling the Position of Elements
* Normal flow (default behavior (
* Relative Positioning (keep it in the normal flow , move it but in the containar block)
* absolute positioning (out fo normal flow)
* Fixed Positioning (fixed when scroll uup and down)
* Floating Elements (out of flow)
`note : use z-index to avoid overlap , it allows you to control which one on the top , the element who has higher number will show on the top`
# Using float to place elements side by side
by add width and float , to clear side element use clear

# Screen Sizes ; your site must be design for different screen size
Screen Resolution:number of dots a screen shows per inch.
**page sizes for design is : 960-1000px(wide) and 570-600 px hight**
## Fixed Width Layouts: use px
## Liquid Layouts : use %
# CSS Frameworks : providing the code for common task like (960.GS)
`note : we can import and add link for specific css files in one page`
