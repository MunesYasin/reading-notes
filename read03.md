# HTML 
`HTML` The HyperText **Markup Language**, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser .

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the **structure** of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

## The main parts of our element are as follows:

* The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
* The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
* The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
* The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
